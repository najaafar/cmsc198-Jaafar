# <Month> Week <number>

## Todo
- This week was not that busy since we just continued the Android tutorial using Android Studio. I had to finish custom listview using the base adapter for me to proceed with the authentication of the user with the help of Volley. The succeeding tasks were to implement the Facebook login, and Google Maps API. 

- On the other hand, in my Tap-to-Hire Web Project, there was no assignment or tasks given. Since it was difficult for me to install PostgreSQL in Django in Windows, I did follow many tutorials from websites but I ended up not finishing the task. I approached my mentor (Ate Ia) in that project to seek help, and she told me that she'll teach us in the next few days after all of the things needed for the specifications in our project is done since there might be adjustments.  

- We were also told that there would be a photoshoot on Tuesday (June 21) for our IDs as our official entry to the company as interns. 
- As per the instruction of the CEO of MyPortal Exchange Inc. namely Mr. Richard Yap, we are supposed to present our pitch or business plan on Wednesday (June 22) for the company be able to use the ratedguru domain name which he bought just recently. He said that as programmers, we should also learn thinking about business in industries since we are working with the technology.  

## Done
- (June 20) : I finished the task regarding the Custom Listview with the aid of Base Adapter for 2 hours before lunch break. After that, I started to do the authentication of user by using Volley library. Volley is an HTTP library that makes networking for Android apps easier and most importantly, faster by implementing a transparent cache that allows for quick reloading of data. A user should register first to be able to login. If the inserted data is not yet included in the database, login should fail. The database was a link provided by our mentors. I don't know how they were able to come up with that. It's so amazing. I think I did the task for 3 hours.

- (June 21) : The following day, I fetched the data provided to us in a link and we had to display its contents. I easily familiarized myself with Postman Rest Client since I already kknow how to use Advanced Rest Client since CMSC100. I worked with JSON objects and we made a custom listview showing different menus for lunch. We also used Volley in this task. I did the task for 7 hours since I encountered problems with my Android Studio. Also, a photoshoot was done for our IDs.

- (June 22) : I presented my pitch or business plan for the website to the company. Our bosses including the CEO were there to evaluate our pitch. I proposed a collectibles app or website wherein a wide variety of collectors around the world can showcase their collections and they can put some of their collections up for auction for other aspiring collectors of a certain kind of thing. 

- (June 23) : I did the Facebook Login task within the whole day since I encountered a big problem here. My manifest file was unexpectedly beame not recognized ad I wasn't able to trace down the cause. I sought help from Kuya Pao, my mentor in Tap-To-Hire Android Project, regarding this. Since we weren't able to solve the problem, I was told to just start the project all over again. That was so heartbreaking! After I remade the project, I started to do the Facebook Login task. I finished it then after 2 hours. The task was actually easy if it wasn't because of the problem rearding the root after syncing in the whole project.

- (June 24) : There was no task in the morning and all I did was to register for 2016 Philippine Cloud Summit - IoT: The Pinnacle of Digital which will be held at SMX Convention Center, SM Aura Premier, McKinley Parkway in Taguig. All of the interns were advised to register for this seminar since it would benefit and mold us as a programmer. Then the Welcome Party for Interns was held at the company during lunch break. We then were assigned a task to do the Google Maps API. I wasn't able to finish this task. Few hours later, we were told to attend a BDO Life Seminar which covered mainly about life insurance. 

## To be done
- I still have to do the task regarding the Google API since I wasn't able to finish it. Our mentors said that they will assist us next week since none of us were able to finish the task due to limited time and knowledge about Android. Also, I also have to install PostgreSQL in Django for me to be able to practice prior to the scheduled training. 

## Things learned
- I learned more about Android and found myself loving it. I think I am now more familiar to the environment of Android Studio thanks to those bugs and problems I've encountered. I also learned how to make or think of a pitch, and other things related to life insurance. 

## Hardest task done this week
- I really find it difficult to install PostgreSQL in Django in Windows. What makes me more frustrated is that in Ubuntu, it is so easy. Another problem is that when I added the Volley library. Somewhere in the steps, I clicked "Add root" which I think caused the problem everytime I build the gradle. Thankfully, Kuya Pao, my mentor helped me solve the problem by rebuilding the project again and edited some parts of the code in manifest file and gradle app and settings.
