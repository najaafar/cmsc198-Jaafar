# July Week 2

## Done
- I was done taking up the tutorial for django. I also helped Kuya Carlo edit some stuffs in The Kitchen Bookstore website which has the domain name ratedguru.com. 
- (July 11) : I finished configuring virtual environment.
- (July 12) : I learned how to create a project in Django and how to run it. I learned here that django is a very amazing tool in making a website. It makes making websites more convenient compared to other technologies like Node and PHP. You type a command and edit a few files, then django will do the rest. Django is a free, open, and high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. All you have to do is setup a virtual environment where you want to run your app and other complicated tasks like managing the database will be done by Django.
