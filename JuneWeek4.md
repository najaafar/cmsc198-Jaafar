# June Week 4

## Todo
- This week, we are to think of an app and do it uing Adnroid Studio. What I thought was a FoodGuru mobile application wherein there are many recipes in which people can check so they may be able to do it. We were also told to make a pitch on Monday next wee hence, al of the interns were divided into three groups. We are supposed to make a plan, presentation, and an essay for the pitch.

## Done
- List of things accomplished for the week, put some details on how you did it and put how many hours it took to finish it
- (June 27) : I started to do the application and learned how to put logos and the icon of the application itself. I also learned how to include a loading screen and studied how to include a database helper in android. 
- (June 28) : I searched for many menus in the morning and inserted it in a database with the ghelp of the database helper. 
- (June 29) : We went to 2016 Philippine Cloud Summit with our mentors and other company staffs. The event was about the IoT (Internet of Things) and how it would benefit people. We also learned that it is very applicable since cloud computing nowadays are a hot topic especially for developers and businessmen. The even started at 8:00 am and ended at 12:00 pm. We were given a free time for the rest of the day and spent our afternoon bnding with our mentors and shopping at the SM.
- (June 30) : I continued my FoodGuru application and was able to add listviews and many activity files.
- (July 01) : I continued my application and my groupmates and I brainstormed our ideas for the pitch. We also consulted our assigned mentor Ms. Ia Cabatbat about those ideas.

## To be done
- My groupmates and I should make a presentation regardng the pitch and we have to ask for work in our projects.

## Things learned
- I learned how pitching is done in industry and realized that the world of being a programmer doens't only involve programming but also involves business knowledge and communication skills. I also learned about database helpers and other stuffs which i incorporated into my FoodGuru mobile application.

## Hardest task done this week
- I think the hardest task I did this week was to include a database helper. I had to learn SQLite and other stuffs.
